# svm_image_coloring
a colorization project as an ML introduction

By training off of a single colored image, we see if we can accurately color a similar grayscale image. We experimented with relatively simple images to start.

Some sample results:
![result1](set1.png?raw=false "Results 1")
![result2](set2.png?raw=false "Results 2")
